# PHP-affineGapDistance
A PHP implementation of Affine Gap String Distance

Due to the lack of implementations of this method in PHP I decided to transcribe the only one I've found in Python

Original Cython implementation: https://github.com/datamade/affinegap

Thank you.

# Usage
```php
echo normalizedAffineGapDistance('string1', 'string2');
```
